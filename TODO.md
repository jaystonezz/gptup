# Roadmap and TODO List

## Development Workflow Enhancements
1. Add GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows (testing, linting, deployment).
2. Implement pre-commit hooks for code formatting and linting (e.g., Black, Flake8).
3. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file for containerized deployment.
4. Include VS Code workspace settings for Python, Prettier, and Docker.
5. Add database integration (SQLite or PostgreSQL).

## Mobile-Ready Features
6. Provide a React Native or Flutter starter for mobile app integration.
7. Add endpoints/scripts for push notifications.
8. Implement OAuth for authentication (e.g., Google, GitHub).

## API Enhancements
9. Add rate-limiting to prevent API abuse.
10. Standardize error handling with middleware.
11. Create an API testing suite (e.g., pytest).
12. Add an analytics endpoint to track API usage stats.
13. Support versioned APIs (e.g., `/api/v1`).

## Chatbot Improvements
14. Enable file analysis and summaries via chatbot.
15. Add task automation commands for the chatbot (e.g., "Run repair script").
16. Implement session-based memory for interactive chatbot conversations.

## Ease of Use
17. Add an interactive CLI setup wizard for guided configuration.
18. Use YAML for managing dynamic environment configurations.
19. Include an auto-update script to fetch updates from GitHub.

## Future-Proofing
20. Add deployment guides and scripts for Heroku or similar platforms.

## Additional Enhancement Options

### Development Workflow
1. Add automated database migrations (e.g., Alembic) for schema updates.
2. Create a template generator for new features (e.g., scripts, golden files).
3. Enable multi-environment support (e.g., dev, staging, production) in `.env`.

### Interactive Features
4. Add multi-language support to the CLI and dashboard.
5. Integrate real-time logs into the dashboard using WebSocket streams.
6. Allow customizable themes (dark mode/light mode) for the dashboard.

### Mobile/Cloud Integration
7. Add Google Firebase integration for mobile push notifications.
8. Include AWS S3 support for uploading and managing golden files.
9. Automate Heroku deployment with a single CLI command.

### API and Backend
10. Add JWT-based authentication to secure API endpoints.
11. Include rate-limiting middleware to prevent API abuse.
12. Build a global settings endpoint to centralize configuration.

### Testing and Validation
13. Add end-to-end tests for the CLI and API using tools like Pytest.
14. Include schema validation for golden files to ensure correct formats.
15. Create a mock API server for testing without external dependencies.

### Task Automation
16. Implement scheduled tasks (e.g., auto-backups) using a cron-like system.
17. Build a task dependency resolver to execute tasks in the correct order.

### Ease of Use
18. Add a drag-and-drop interface to upload golden files via the dashboard.
19. Provide quick start scripts for Docker and containerized environments.

### Advanced Features
20. Develop a pluggable architecture to allow external integrations (e.g., plugins for CI/CD).
